MenuManager

Project started because I didn't want to run some commands from terminal every time (e.g., jupyter notebook) and wanted to automate some stuff. Probably could have looked up how to do this with the built in automator but there's no fun in that ;)

This is the last snapshot of the Swift 3 version. Future updates will all be in Swift 4.
